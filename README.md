## Installation / 安装

There are basicly three ways to install this package on your system:

* Install from package manager;
* Just unpack from the development package;
* Install from the development package to the TDS manually.

### Install from package manager

Both TeX Live and MiKTeX have their own package manager.

For TeX Live, the name is `tlmgr`. To install `sduthesis` from `tlmgr`, all you have to do is run

    tlmgr install sduthesis

For those who install TeX Live as `root` privilege (include MacTeX on OS X), you may need to run this with the `sudo` prefix.

For MiKTeX, the name is MiKTeX Package Manager, which is known as `mpm` for short. You could run `mpm` from the Start Menu, or just type `mpm` in your CMD window. `mpm` has a friendly GUI, which means that you can easily find `sduthesis` by using the filter and install the package with the `+` button.

### Unpack from the development package

If you are interested in this kind of way to install the package, the first thing that come up in your mind shoud be that you are not trying to install the package into your TeX system, but trying to make a Green Unpack.

Firstly, you need to download the latest release of the package from the homepage: <http://liam0205.me/sduthesis/>.

For *nix users, you should execute the build script in the terminal.

    /path/to/sduthesis/build

For Windows users, just double click the `build.bat`.

### Install to TDS munally

You should follow the instructions listed in the previous section, and then

* put `sduthesis.ins` and `sduthesis.dtx` to `TEXMF/source/latex/sduthesis/`
* put `sduthesis.cls`, `*.def` and `figures/' to `TEXMF/tex/latex/sduthesis/`
* put the remaining files to `TEXMF/doc/latex/sduthesis/`

Here `TEXMF` stands for one of your TDS root. After doing so, you should execute `texhash` in your terminal to refresh the `ls-R` database, which makes TeX knowing where the package is.
